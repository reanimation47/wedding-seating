A simple, elegant frontend-only wedding seating application that allows guests to find their table and check in. Features a beautiful visual floor plan with white and dark green theming.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Guests can search for their name to find their table
3. The app will show their table location on the visual floor plan
4. Guests can check in, and their status will be saved locally

## File Structure

```
wedding-seating/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main guest interface
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # Styling and theme
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js           # All functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ guests.json     # Guest name to table mappings
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tables.json     # Table positions and layout
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This file
```

## Updating Guest List

Edit `data/guests.json` to add, remove, or modify guest assignments:

```json
{
  "Guest Name": "Table Number",
  "John Smith": "Table 1",
  "Jane Smith": "Table 1",
  "Mr. & Mrs. Johnson": "Table 2"
}
```

### Guest Name Tips:
- Include multiple variations (e.g., "John Smith", "Mr. & Mrs. Smith")
- Use family names for groups (e.g., "Smith Family")
- The search is flexible and will match partial names

## Updating Table Layout

Edit `data/tables.json` to modify table positions:

```json
{
  "tables": [
    {
      "number": "Table 1",
      "x": 150,
      "y": 200,
      "radius": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

### Table Configuration:
- **number**: Table identifier (must match guest assignments)
- **x, y**: Position coordinates (0-800 for x, 0-600 for y)
- **radius**: Table size (30 is standard)

### Layout Tips:
- The floor plan is 800x600 pixels
- Stage area is at the top (y: 50-130)
- Dance floor is in the center (x: 320-480, y: 270-430)
- Leave space around the dance floor for easy navigation

## Check-in System

The app uses browser localStorage to track check-ins:

- **Per Device**: Each device tracks its own check-ins
- **Persistent**: Data survives browser refresh
- **Privacy**: No external servers, completely local

### Debug Functions (Browser Console):
- `getCheckedInGuests()` - View all checked-in guests
- `clearAllCheckIns()` - Reset all check-ins (for testing)

## Customization

### Colors
Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-green: #2D5016;    /* Main green color */
    --light-green: #E8F5E8;      /* Light background */
    --accent-green: #4A7C59;     /* Hover states */
}
```

### Fonts
Current fonts: Playfair Display (headings) + Inter (body)
Change the Google Fonts import in `styles.css` to use different fonts.

### Layout
Modify the floor plan background in `script.js`:
- `addFloorPlanBackground()` function
- Adjust stage, dance floor, or add new elements
